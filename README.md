# Exploring HuBERT

Let's explore the HuBERT implementation that is provided as part of `torchaudio`. The `wav2vec2` folder is directly copied from [`torchaudio/models/wav2vec2`](https://github.com/pytorch/audio/tree/v2.0.2/torchaudio/models/wav2vec2) in the `torchaudio` [2.0.2 release](https://github.com/pytorch/audio/releases/tag/v2.0.2).
